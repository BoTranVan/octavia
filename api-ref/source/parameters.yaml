fields:
  description: |
    The fields that you want the server to return.
    If no ``fields`` query parameter is specified,

    By using the ``fields`` parameter, the API returns only the requested set
    of attributes. The ``fields`` parameter can be specified multiple times.
    For example, if you specify ``fields=id&fields=name`` in the request URL,
    only the ``id`` and ``name`` attributes will be returned.
